Bugfix
   * Fix a build issue when defining MBEDTLS_TIMING_ALT and MBEDTLS_SELF_TEST.
     The library would not link if the user didn't provide an external self-test
     function. The self-test is now provided regardless of the choice of
     internal/alternative timing implementation. Fixes #6923.
